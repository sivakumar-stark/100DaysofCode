# 100DaysofCode
Hi everyone,

I have just decided to move from my support role to development. I will be sharing the notes and preparations here to get into the developer role. If you are just like me, who doesn't know coding but wants to become a developer, feel free to let me know â€“ we will grow together.

The coming 100 days will be a tracker for my progress. I will see you guys every day with the new update.

Thank you.
